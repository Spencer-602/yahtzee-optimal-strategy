This repo implements the dynamic programming algorithm described in James Glenn's May 2006 paper "An Optimal Strategy for Yahtzee". 
The strategy is the version without Yahtzee bonus and written in python.

An online version of the same strategy can be found here (developed by Tom Verhoeff, Erik Scheffers)
